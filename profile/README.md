# Hey there! Welcome to Two Palms Creative 🌴

I'm Ashley — creative strategist, frontend WordPress developer, and the heart behind Two Palms Creative.

Here, I build branded WordPress themes with personality. Each one is crafted for creative entrepreneurs, small business owners, and service providers who want a site that actually *feels like them* — strategic, stylish, and seriously standout.

## ✨ What I’m Building

At Two Palms Creative, I focus on creating modern, block-based WordPress themes using Full Site Editing (FSE).

All my themes are designed to be:

- 🧠 **Strategy-first** – built around brand clarity + clear messaging
- 🎨 **Visually distinct** – layouts that feel fresh, not cookie-cutter
- 🛠️ **Easy to edit** – no code needed, just click + customize
- ⚡ **Fast + flexible** – optimized for performance + scalability

They're built for people who care about design *and* want a site that works hard behind the scenes.

## 🔨 Theme Ecosystem

### [`tpc-base-theme`](https://github.com/twopalmscreative/tpc-base-theme)
The foundation of every theme I create. Built on top of [WDS-BT](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-BT), this is where all the core logic, accessibility improvements, and block styling lives.

### Coming Soon:

- 🌺 `verve-theme` – a bold, editorial-inspired theme built for brands with something to say
- 🌿 `bloom-theme` – a softer, romantic layout perfect for coaches + creatives
- 🔥 More specialty themes coming in 2025

## 🧠 Why Themes?

Not everyone needs a custom site—but everyone deserves a site that feels custom.

TPC themes are the bridge between templates that fall flat and expensive builds that take months. They’re designed with your voice + visuals in mind, so you can launch confidently and grow with ease.

## 👋 A Little About Me

I’m Ashley — a frontend WordPress developer who loves transforming ideas into digital spaces that *feel like home*. I’ve worked with brands big and small, built dozens of websites, and now I’m turning that experience into ready-to-go themes you’ll actually enjoy using.

When I’m not deep in code or colors, you’ll find me exploring Charleston, hosting game nights, or chasing the sunshine.
