## 💻 What We Do

We create modern, block-based WordPress themes designed to:

- Tell your brand story clearly
- Look beautiful across devices
- Be easy to edit (even if you’re not “techy”)
- Load fast + perform like a dream

Our themes are built using WordPress Full Site Editing (FSE) and follow best practices for accessibility, SEO, and performance.

## 🧱 Our Theme Ecosystem

### 🔹 [`tpc-base-theme`](https://github.com/twopalmscreative/tpc-base-theme)
Our foundational theme—built on top of [WDS-BT](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-BT) and customized for TPC projects. This is where shared functionality, styling standards, and structural elements live.

### 🌺 `verve-theme` (coming soon!)
A bold and editorial theme designed for brands with something to say.

### 🌿 `bloom-theme` (coming soon!)
A softer, more romantic aesthetic for coaches, creatives, and lifestyle brands.

Themes are fully customizable, lightning-fast, and built with intention—inside and out.
